# JSON-B Message Body Reader/Writer

Gives applications the ability to have TextMessage containing json to be unmarshalled as a Java object that is then passed into the Jakarta Messaging annotated method.

## Proposed API Classes

 - none

## Assumptions

 - Assumes some form of mime type is added to the specification 

## Advantages

 - Without some form of unmarshalling it would not be possible to have methods such as `@TopicListener public void consume(Project project)` that can consume TextMessages.  Applications would be limited to `@TopicListener public void consume(TextMessage message)`  

## Limitations/Drawbacks

 - Limited to messages of type `TextMessage`.  Not applicable to other message types.

## Open Questions

 - How would we specify the mime type?  A separate proposal would be required, likely defining a new standard Message Header.

 - Would we also want a MessageBodyReader and MessageBodyWriter API like Jakarta REST has?  Theoretically we could support JSON-B marshalling as a built-in feature and still add a reader/writer concept in the future without conflict. 
 
## Depends on Proposals

 - annotation-based-api
